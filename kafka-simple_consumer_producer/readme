Set up in Windows environment.

1. Go to bin/windows Kafka directory: cd <path to kafka>/bin/windows
2. Run zookeeper: zookeeper-server-start.bat ../../config/zookeeper.properties
3. Run kafka server: kafka-server-start.bat ../../config/server.properties
4. Create a topic: kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic MyTopic
5. Run consumer and producer applications and observe results

N.B Kafka server connects to zookeeper (on port 2181 by default) and will listen for socket connections on port 9092 by default. These 
    configurations can be chaged. Therefore consumer and producer has to connect to the server on 9092 to communicate. Their properties 
    should be set properly. 
    
Extra knowledge

console consumer:
      kafka-console-consumer.bat --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic MyTopic --from-beginning    

console producer:
      kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic MyTopic
