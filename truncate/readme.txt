1. In this assignment the truncate logic is written in the StringUtil class. I have uploaded test cases too.
2. Controller is injected with OrderDetails service, which uses a mock repositoy to get an arbitrary string values for order details.
3. The project can be built and deployed. HTTP GET request can be sent to http://<host>:<port>/subscribe with a subscriber id. 
   I have logged the trucated message to console. However, a result page is not displayed (a 404 error occurs) as it is out of scope of the assigment. 
4. Test cases to the contoller end point are written.
5. subscriber.properties file has properties I assumed which are subject to change.
